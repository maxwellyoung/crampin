				, trained in Design Innovation and specialising in bringing brand
				stories to life through motion. While studying Media Design at Victoria
				University of Wellington, I found my love of motion design and
				videography in which I used the mediums to tell stories. I also found a
				love for sound design and producing music at University which I like to
				pair with the content I create. In the last year, I have partnered with
				studios in making brands move, create real engagement, and amplify the
				true character of a brand or an initiative. Putting a focus on why
				design moves and how it can tell a story. I have also ventured further
				into film and video work, creating documentary-style motion pieces for
				brands like Tui and Changemaker and singlehandedly
				directing/filming/producing/editing music videos for emerging artist
				Fletcher Valentine. The areas of work have been diverse – from power
				brand Cat – to new breed start-ups such as Deja and sustainability
				champions Circularity. I have worked alongside the talented team at Milk
				NZ that won 8 awards at the 2020 Best Awards and have worked with a wide
				range of progressive businesses and brands. I am continuing to push my
				craft and grow my skill set by moving into new areas of motion, working
				on bigger-scale shoots, and venturing into photography, with an aim to
				add dimension and life through animation and motion creating design that
				moves.
